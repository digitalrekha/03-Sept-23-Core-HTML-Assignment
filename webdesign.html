    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>Web design is the process of planning, creating, and maintaining websites. It encompasses a broad range of
        disciplines, including graphic design, user experience (UX) design, and interface (UI) design. Web designers
        work to create websites that are both visually appealing and easy to use. <br><br>
        Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that appears regardless of the resolution governed
        by the device. It's typically accomplished with viewport breakpoints (resolution cut-offs for when content
        scales to that view). The viewports should adjust logically on tablets, phones, and desktops of any resolution.
