    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites. It encompasses a wide range of tasks, from designing and developing the user interface (UI) to writing the code that powers the website's functionality. Web developers use a variety of programming languages and tools to create websites that are both visually appealing and easy to use. There are two main types of web development: front-end and back-end. Front-end development is focused on the user-facing aspects of a website, such as the layout, colors, and interactive features. Back-end development is focused on the server-side logic and data management of a website.
